### Greetings! 👋

I am a fresh Ph.D. in Computer Science from KAIST. My specialty is in applied machine learning for physical interfaces & HCI methods for user study and analysis. My doctoral research spanned multiple domains, including eye tracking, gaze analysis, XR/VR, and haptics. 

I've presented several projects at top-tier HCI conferences such as ACM CHI and UIST. If you're interested, please feel free to explore my website and repositories!
