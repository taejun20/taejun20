### Greetings! 👋

I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://hcil.kaist.ac.kr/">HCI Lab</a> in KAIST. My research interest lies in eye tracking, gaze-based interaction method and analysis, AR/VR, and understanding and modeling of user behavior.

I've presented several projects at top-tier HCI conferences such as ACM CHI and UIST. If you're interested, please feel free to explore my website and repositories!
