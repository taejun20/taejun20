### Greetings! 👋

I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://hcil.kaist.ac.kr/">HCI Lab</a> in KAIST. My curiosity lies in discovering the maximum potential of utilizing our eyes for Human-Computer Interaction, researching opportunities and challenges of gaze-based interactions. Beyond my primary interest, I also have a fascination with haptics and various text entry techniques.

I've presented several projects at top-tier HCI conferences such as ACM CHI and UIST. If you're interested, please feel free to explore my website and repositories!
